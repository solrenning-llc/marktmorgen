# Reservations of Claude 4

Only Claude 4 edits this file (owner decision 04/11/2026, inbox C4-1). Add a row before the first commit of a unit, in the same pull request as the code; remove it in the pull request that merges the unit. Never reserve a shared or generated file (see `SHARED_FILES` in `scripts/reservation-check.mjs`). `scripts/reservation-check.mjs` reads every file in `docs/reservations/` and fails a pull request that changes a file another agent reserved, or that changes another agent's reservations file. The lanes and branch prefixes stay in [docs/reservations.md](../reservations.md).
