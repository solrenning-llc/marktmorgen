/**
 * A student finishing a course (added 12 October 2026): the moment the last
 * lesson of it is marked done, by a button, a quiz passed or work approved.
 *
 * It is the best moment a course has to offer the next thing — Kajabi and
 * Teachable both start automations on it — and until now nothing happened
 * then. Now the sequences that start "when someone finishes" a course
 * (lib/flows.ts, trigger "finished") start for that student, if they agreed
 * to hear from the creator; nobody else is written to.
 *
 * A student finishes once: a flag kept for 400 days says it happened, so a
 * lesson marked undone and done again does not start anything twice.
 *
 * Opening a course for the first time (added 17 October 2026) starts the
 * sequences that start "when someone opens" it, in the same way and once,
 * which is the welcome into a course that Kajabi and Teachable send.
 *
 * Reaching a share of it (287 [H4-1], added 12 November 2026): each lesson
 * marked done also starts the sequences that start "when someone has done N%
 * of" the course, for every N at or below the whole percent of its lessons
 * now done. No mark of its own is kept: each sequence starts a person once
 * (lib/flows.ts, startFlows), so marking a lesson undone and done again
 * starts nothing twice.
